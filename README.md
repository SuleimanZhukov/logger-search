# Logger Search Application

The only search that is working in this is application is "From Date" and "To Date" and employee name, because I couldn't make it filter all the searches at ones. I was able to make them work separately, but not all at ones, so I kept "From Date To Date" and Employee name only.

That was the first thing I couldn't do, and the second thing is that I didn't have time to make the synchronization between the search field and the URL. That's it.

To use this app:

1. Select 'From Date' and 'To Date' and then search.
2. Then you can filter by Employee name, it's the Log ID.
3. All other filter doesn't work as I explained above.
