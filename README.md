# Logger Search Application

The only search that is working in this is application is "From Date" and "To Date", because I couldn't make it filter all the searches at ones. I was able to make them work separately, but not all at ones, so I kept "From Date" and "To Date" only.

That was the first thing I couldn't do, and the second thing is that I didn't have time to make the synchronization between the search field and the URL. That's it.

I will try to make everything work in Friday and Saturday.
